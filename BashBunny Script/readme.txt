Method of calling SmartFileExtractor is based on the existing EXE run posted on the Bash Bunny
Wiki. Change the following:
- payload.txt: change your file volume name for the bashbunny (if necessary)
  Note: Very much recommend you do this, otherwise will be picked up by forensics
- e.cmd: change your options for the extract her

Good luck!
